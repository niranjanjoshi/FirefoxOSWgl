Listing 8.3. Finding out what is stored in pointers.
1: // Listing 8.3 What is stored in a pointer.
2:
3:  #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
4:
5: typedef unsigned short int USHORT;
6: int main()
7: {
8: unsigned short int myAge = 5, yourAge = 10;
9: unsigned short int * pAge = &myAge; // a pointer
10:
11: cout << "myAge:\t" << myAge << "\tyourAge:\t" << yourAge
<< "\n";
12: cout << "&myAge:\t" << &myAge << "\t&yourAge:\t" <<
&yourAge <<"\n";
13:
14: cout << "pAge:\t" << pAge << "\n";
15: cout << "*pAge:\t" << *pAge << "\n";
16:
17: pAge = &yourAge; // reassign the pointer
18:
19: cout << "myAge:\t" << myAge << "\tyourAge:\t" << yourAge
<< "\n";
20: cout << "&myAge:\t" << &myAge << "\t&yourAge:\t" <<
&yourAge <<"\n";
21:
22: cout << "pAge:\t" << pAge << "\n";
23: cout << "*pAge:\t" << *pAge << "\n";
24:
25: cout << "&pAge:\t" << &pAge << "\n";
26: return 0;
27: }
Output: myAge: 5 yourAge: 10
&myAge: 0x355C &yourAge: 0x355E
pAge: 0x355C
*pAge: 5
myAge: 5 yourAge: 10
&myAge: 0x355C &yourAge: 0x355E
pAge: 0x355E
*pAge: 10
&pAge: 0x355A
